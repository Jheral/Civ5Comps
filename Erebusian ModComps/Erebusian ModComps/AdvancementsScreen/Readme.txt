A new screen for Technologies, Social Policies and Ideological Tenets, that is more flexible and more friendly to modding.

Social Policies - Each policy branch now has its own screen, with plenty of space for a bigger tree of policies. Branches are loaded dynamically from the database, and it can therefore show as many branches as you would want to be in the game. Furthermore, classes can be assigned to policy branches, making it possible to split them over multiple tabs.

Ideological Tenets - As with social policies, classes have been introduced, letting you have many different pages of Ideologies. More Ideologies can be added at will, and all of them will be shown whether or not they are adopted. The tenets themselves have also been reworked, and are now shown in a more dynamic and flexible way, allowing more tiers of tenets, as well as more tenets per tier.

Technologies - Classes have been introduced, as has tech trees - these can now be defined seperately, so you can have many different tech trees at the same time (although you can still only research one tech at a time). As many tech trees and classes as you want can be added, and will be shown in the same way as the policy branches. Most of the information that used to be in the nodes in the vanilla tree is now in the tooltip of the node.
