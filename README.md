Civilization 5 Modcomps

This is a repository intended to be used to gather and merge modcomponents, in an effort to make modding of civ5 easier for everyone involved. Any component uploaded here are free for use, as long as credit is given to their creator, and as long as the use is non-profit.

When making an addition to the repo, make sure to add a description of the component, and clear instructions - both as concerns installation, and as to which dependencies the component has. This will make it much easier for people to use the component in their own mods.

When making DLL or Lua modifications, please mark any additions you make as such:

 // [Name of component] - [The latest version number that changed the code segment], [Your Username]
 
 [Your addition here]
 
 // END [Name of component]
 
This will make it easier for all people involved to see what you have changed, and use the component.

Keep modding, and let's make the Civ5 modding scene as great as the Civ4 scene was!
